        There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting inspired by other businesses on Instagram. WHere it becomes a concern is when you are constantly tweaking your brand/business messages to look like theirs.

        <br />
        <p>
        In running any business, think sustainability, longevity and transgenerational.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        You are in business for a reason and your WHY must always inform the business actions you take.Â

        At Gold Sycamore, we recognized that a number of clients want one or more of the solutions listed below. They want to:
        </p>
        <div className="what-we-offer">
          {
            data.map((item, index) => (
              <article key={index}>
                <div>
                  {item.icon}
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    {item.title}
                  </p>
                </div>
              </article>
            ))
          }
        </div>
        <p>
        Whichever adequately describes you, best believe we have a ready solution.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Again, you'll probably stand out more when you concentrate primarily on your company rather than your rivals.
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>
